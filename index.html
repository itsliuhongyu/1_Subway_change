              <br>When I was in primary school, having too much free time, I used to love exploring Beijing, the city where I grew up.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>I loved riding my foldable bicycle through the narrow downtown alleys. I loved dashing up the stairs of a double decker bus and sit on the front seat for the best view of the street. Also, I loved riding the subway which was warm in winter, and chill in summer.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>By the time, there were only four subway lines in Beijing, and I rode every each of them. Again, I had too much free time.

              <br>However, I got carried away as I went to middle school, high school, and eventually college. I stopped paying much attention to what is happening to the transportation system that I commute everyday.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>Fast forward to 2020 when I returned home for summer, I realized that I can no longer navigate through this gigatic subway system without the help from my phone.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>Where do these subway lines go to? When were they opened? More importantly, since when I start to loose track on the change in subway lines?

              <br>To answer the question, I traced the opening year of each Beijing subway line with the exception of lines one and two. Both were already in use when I was born in 2000. The details for my calculations can be found in Github.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>From 2000 to 2023, the Beijing subway expanded from 2 to 24 lines. The total line distance increased by seven folds, from 184.71km to 1446.34km. The boom in scale made it difficult for me to remember these new lines.

              <br>The Beijing subway system developed slowly before 2007. Line 13 was opened in 2002 initially as a commuter rail, and Batong Line was opened in 2003 as an extension of Line 1.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>The opening of Line 5 in 2007 was a landmark for the city as it ran through several most populated neighborhoods in the city. I rode this line the most often when I was in primary school.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br>Line 5, as well as Line 10 and Line 8 (both partially opened in 2008), were built to prepare the city for the 2008 Olympic games. These lines were later expanded to be practical for long-term operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br>The total line distance increased the most in 2010. Due to the opening of several suburban lines, more than 200km of subway lines were added to the system.

              <br>The increase in length each year roughly shows a cycled pattern. It is because these lines were designed in phases. For example, <a href="https://zfxxgk.ndrc.gov.cn/web/iteminfo.jsp?id=325">the second phase was built from 2015-2021. </a> Correspondingly, fewer subways were built in 2015 as the new plan was still in the blueprint stage. The next cycle will take place from <a href="https://www.camet.org.cn/xydt/9362">2022-2027. </a>
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>In conclusion, I do not think there is a specific time that I suddenly lose my ability to navigate through the Beijing subway system. The system expanded rather steadily, but I was simply not paying attention to these changes. (I know it is not newsworthy at all. But this is what this assignment is about, right?)
